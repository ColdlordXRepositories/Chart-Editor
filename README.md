# Chart-Editor
Quick and easy FNF chart editor for mobile phones!
Chart editor allows you to make Friday Night Funkin' charts on Android (maybe IOS sometime in the future) quick and easy when you can't be on your PC at the moment.
You can pick from 4 different engines: Base, Kade, Psych (including events and custom notes), and Forever Engine!
You can test with the in game chart tester, which is very similar to the chart testing mode on Psych.
